<div>GIVEN THAT</div>
<div>a) traditional industries carry natural resistance to innovation, and</div>
<div>b) The average productive hour per day is <a href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html">not even 3 hours</a></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>ADVISE</div>
<div>1. Allocate 55% of your resources to incremental innovation = Horizon 1: With 55% of the focus on horizon 1, it forces corporations to streamline efficiency and results, instead of leaning in a comfort zone to dedicate 70% (!!). 70% of 8 hrs = 5.40min
    (aka 6hrs of 8hrs). With 55% dedication to incremental innovation, it creates similar urge feeling entrepreneurs have in their startups, where every hour counts.</div>
<div><br>2. Allocate 40% resources into emerging activity. Meaning double the effort (from 20 to 40) in order to increase the odds to have enough experiments going in Horizons 2 where you consider new products, new target audiences and new business models
    â€¦ which will grant you to reposition mid-to-long term. This Horizon 2 percentage weight will reduce many traditional industries from falling behind</div>
<div><br>Allocate only 5% to Horizon 3 activities, in order to be VERY strategic on what these 5% are dedicated.High risks, low stake - laser-focused.</div>
