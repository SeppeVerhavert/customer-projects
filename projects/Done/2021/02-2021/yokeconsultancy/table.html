<p class="font-medium"><strong><span class="font-large" style="color: rgb(231, 99, 99);">Five guidance points<br></span></strong><br></p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #808080; padding: 5px;">1. <strong>Holistic</strong> - the extent to which pathways are interconnected and linked to the whole<br><br>It is interesting to acknowledge how our resilience pathways relate and are better understood when considered as a whole. We cannot manage our
    resilience in a siloed fashion and expect positive or negative actions in one pathway not to affect the status of other pathways. Instead we need to appreciate that resilience transcends across our work and non-work life and our ability to treat our
    resilience in a whole way, enables us to create sustainability within it.</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #808080; padding: 5px;" class="font-medium"><br>2. <strong>Diversity</strong> - the extent to which you leverage all eight pathways of resilience <br><br><em>I</em>t is interesting to reflect on how diverse your approach to resilience is. Some of us may have a tendency to (over) rely on one or
    two pathways. Albeit it is positive that we have refined our approach in specific areas, we must also be aware that the lack of breadth in our resilience skillset can limit our ability to flex and bounce back when circumstances change. The more we
    can develop a variety of resilience pathways the more robust our approach becomes. </p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #808080; padding: 5px;" class="font-medium"><br>3. <strong>Self awareness</strong> - the extent to which you evaluate your resilience in an accurate way<br><br>It is interesting to note that factors such as age and gender can initially affect how accurately we assess resilience. For example men
    can over-estimate and women under-estimate resilience, relating to factors such as hormonal cycles. Age can also affect which resilience language or pathway we are more attuned to. However with an active and honest practice we significantly lift our
    self awareness and subsequently the accuracy of our predictions, regardless of demography.</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #808080; padding: 5px;" class="font-medium"><br>4. <strong>Change landscape </strong>- the extent to which significant external conditions affect our resilience<br><br>It is interesting to reflect on how stressful we rate this measurement period. During stressful or change heavy times we have a
    tendency to do less for our resilience, despite the fact we need it more. In this context it is useful to consider how we prepare, get through and recover from change, in order to become more artful at bouncing back. From here we can even welcome
    change as a tool that helps us bounce forward to a place that serves our future resilience better.</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid #808080; padding: 5px;" class="font-medium"><br>5. <strong>Score longevity </strong>- the length of time you have experienced your current score<br><br>It is interesting to reflect on how long you have been in your current resilience state. This enables us to better appreciate how much we naturally
    oscillate over time. This is especially relevant in stressful periods when we need to be more astute at noticing subtle declines in our resilience over time; something Yoke calls the “drip drip drip effect.” From here we can spot burnout signs earlier
    and make necessary changes before they get to an unsustainable and irreversible state.<em></em><strong><span class="font-large" style="color: rgb(231, 99, 99);"><br>
