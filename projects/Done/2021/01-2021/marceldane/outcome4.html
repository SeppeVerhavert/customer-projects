<div><br>Even though you may display all postures in different situations throughout your day, the posture that you will likely display most often is the posture of being <strong>Heavy</strong>. Being in this posture has some incredible advantages for you
    and your success is largely attributed to how you mastered this posture. However, like with so many other things in life, what is a Strength in one situation, may possibly be a Weakness in another. Being aware when to leverage on your default posture,
    but also when to pull back from that posture, will help you manage your energy, get along with people who live in other postures, and accomplish more in your day.<br></div>

<div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having a Heavy Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>When you demonstrate that Heavy Posture, you are in an unmovable mood. You are the realistic team-member who is able to offer a sense of reality to the conversation. In a Heavy Posture, you know what you are talking about and are the specialist who is
    brought into the team who knows how to get from point A to point Z. Your work is meticulous and you take great comfort in working in a field where you are the expert.</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><u><span class="font-large">Three Values of Being In A&nbsp;Heavy Posture:</span></u><br></p>
<p><strong>1. People Can Count On Your Expertise:</strong><br></p>
<p>When in a Heavy Posture, it is easy for you to tap into your breadth of knowledge. Your quiet demeanor lets you speak only when something is worth saying. And that means that when you do speak, people can count on you for knowing what you are talking
    about. Your confidence in your knowledge inspires confidence in others and when it comes to problem-solving, you are the go-to person.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. You Bring Stability To The Conversation:</strong></p>
<p>In times of change or crisis, people tend to turn to you for advice. Much more than your knowledge, you have the ability to dig deeper into the subject matter than anyone else. In your Heavy Posture, you are strong in your beliefs between what is right
    and what is wrong and that can inspire a sense of stability and confidence in your team.<br></p>
<p><strong>3. You Get The Job Done, No Matter What:</strong><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being in a Heavy Posture helps you&nbsp;prioritize doing the work necessary to produce results. You are not afraid to roll up the sleeves and get to work yourself. Nobody on your team is more dedicated to finishing the task and solving problems as you
    are. You are also a person of strong values and when you make a promise, you are committed to keeping that promise. Your ability to deliver results and dig deep into subject matter makes you a valuable asset on any team.</p>
<p><br></p>

    </span><br></p>
<div><br></div>
<div>
    <p>Being in a Heavy Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who looks at everything from a "Glass Half Empty" perspective. One of the challenges that you can experience in this posture is that people
        don't like to include you in brain-storming sessions because they may perceive you as a bit of a buzz-kill. On top of that, if you encounter someone who is extremely passionate about their point of view, you tend to shut down rather than speaking
        up. This can result in the danger of becoming invisible and you may even find yourself being passed over for promotions by people who are less senior than you are.</p>
    <p>Being too Heavy and Unmovable in your area of knowledge can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived positivity while not being assertive could be perceived by others as being "passive-aggressive" and may result
        in people not wanting to include you in larger conversations.</p>

<div><span class="font-large"><u>Three Challenges While Being In A&nbsp;Heavy Posture:</u></span></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. You May Be Viewed As Being Too Inflexible.</strong></p>
<p>In situations that require a different posture from being Heavy, you may find yourself feeling like a fish out of water. For example, while the team is brainstorming you may find yourself often disagreeing with ideas because they don't seem practical,
    functional, or realistic. In these instances, your Heavy Posture may be interpreted as being inflexible.&nbsp;Over time, your team members may stop sharing new ideas with you, which could&nbsp;result in a break-down of communication and trust.</p>
<p><strong><br>2. You May Struggle With Change:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Being in a Heavy Posture may serve you well in times of stability, but being too stable could mean that you struggle in times of disruption or if change is initiated from leadership. Your Heavy Posture may predispose you to digging your
    heels into what you know best and you may find yourself struggling with pivoting away from your comfort zone, which is what you know. Your hesitation in responding to change with enthusiasm may result in a lack of confidence from your stakeholders
    during dynamic times and you may find yourself being left out of meetings regarding change initiatives.</p>
<p><strong><br>3. </strong><strong>You Struggle With Conflict:</strong><br></p>
<p>People who have a tendency to be challenging in nature and who are assertive in their opinions toward you may make you feel uncomfortable. Your tendency to about how to get the job done before you speak can result in a misinterpretation from a challenging
    person that you are shutting down. Your silence could result in an escalation in energy from others who are impatient leading to a possible break-down in communication.</p>

<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Wellness Concerns of a Heavy Posture</span></strong></p>

<div><br></div>
<p>Being in a Heavy&nbsp;Posture is characterized by being in a Stable&nbsp;and Grounded&nbsp;State, which requires the body and mind to be&nbsp;in a continuously contracted and unmovable posture. When spending too much time in a contracted&nbsp;state, you
    may find yourself in a position where your body and mind become so accustomed to being contracted that&nbsp;initiating a change in posture becomes difficult for you. The ability to be agile in both mind and body is a necessary requirement for recovery.
    Without recovery, you run the risk of burning out at some point if you spend too much time being stuck in a Heavy&nbsp;Posture.</p>
<p>If you find yourself being in a Heavy Posture for too long, it will be important for you to practice deliberate self-care activities at strategic times of the day so your mind and your body have an opportunity to recover. One of the most effective ways
    of practicing this is to practice shifting yourself deliberately to another posture from time to time as each posture utilizes energy differently and therefore become complementary systems to your Default posture.</p>
<p>What this means is that practicing different postures does not only help you communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, it also becomes a practice of self-care and wellness while also being more effective in how you manage your work and
    relationships. But, before we can practice how to shift postures, let's first explore the other postures.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Determined Posture, you are able to drive initiatives and get things done. You are able to communicate clearly what you want and setting boundaries with others is easier for you. Being Determined also helps you thrive in a competitive
    environment and enables you to dominate in certain situations so you can exert autonomy and knowledge onto others. Being in a Determined posture enables you to focus on, and control outcomes. In this posture, you find yourself more able to be more
    questioning and be more independent-minded. You're more comfortable opposing other points of view and expressing your own point of view with conviction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Determined Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<p>Being in a Determined Posture all the time is exhausting! Posturing yourself to get people and projects moving requires a lot of energy and that energy is not always positive. Spending too much time in the posture of being Determined can result in burn-out
    in some people and for many people, it can feel difficult to move out of that space, even in a social setting or with the people you love.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Determined Posture all the
    time. Sometimes being Determined can be interpreted by others as being aggressive, forceful, and even met with distrust. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to work with you as much.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Light Posture -&nbsp;Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Light-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="ekocaqg0l3am"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Light Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Light Posture, you are in a flexible mood. You are able to get along with everyone and you can find humor in almost any situation. Being Light helps you thrive in a competitive environment by building strong relationships and
    having a network of people who love to help you out where possible.</p>
<p>Your new-found enthusiasm, especially in times of crisis, can be a powerful antidote for stress and anxiety in your team-members. You become a beacon of hope and your ability to collaborate with anyone will open the door to opportunities that otherwise
    may never have been opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Light Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<p>Being in a Light Posture all the time can be challenging because life is not always fun and games. Being too flexible and sociable in times of urgency can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Light Mood. A lack of urgency could mean that deadlines
    are not met and promises are not kept. This in return could reduce trust in the people you work with.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Light Posture all the time. Sometimes being Light can be interpreted
    by others as being flakey and not able to take things seriously. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to recruit you in some exciting projects or even for more senior roles in your career.</p>

<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Inviting Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Inviting-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="q1uszctemhxu"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having an Inviting Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Inviting Posture, you are in an open mood. You are the diplomatic team-member who is known as a good listener and who can find understanding in other people's points of view, even if you disagree with them. People like to come
    to you with their problems and you genuinely care about how they feel. In times of dramatic change, you are the person who will be asked to initiate a change-management strategy because you are known to be the person whom leadership can count on to
    take on this new challenge.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having an Inviting Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in an Inviting Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of becoming everyone's doormat. Saying <strong>No</strong> is a challenge for you because you feel bad for people who have a problem and you want to be supportive and
    help them through their challenges. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people with challenges and sometimes taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling utterly exhausted by the end of the day. In this posture, it is also very difficult
    for you to prioritize your own wellbeing because you tend to put the needs of others first. Ultimately, this could result in burn-out.</p>
<p>Being too open and inviting can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Inviting Mood all the time. A lack of assertiveness while being too agreeable could mean that you have too much on your plate. This in return could result in a less than satisfactorily
    quality of work and could even reduce your ability to meet deadlines altogether resulting in a reduction of trust in the people you work with.</p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Neutral Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Neutral-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="3996p9b75pjr"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Neutral Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Neutral Posture, you are in an accepting mood. You are the neutral team-member who is able to shift energy with anyone else in the room. In a Neutral Posture, you are instantly adaptable and can work with complete consciousness
    and mindfulness so you can be fully present and experience all factors of life and career with all required postures. You are emotionally unmoved by the events that happen in your life, leaving you with energy and vitality to spare.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where having a Neutral Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in a Neutral Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who doesn't care about the situation you are in. The display of emotion and mood is also extremely neutral making it difficult for people to read
    where you stand in your opinions and thoughts. This neutrality could lead to people not able to feel connected with you while working on a team and this could lead to distrust.</p>
<p>Being too Neutral and Unaffected can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived care while not displaying your passion for life and circumstances could lead to people not feeling comfortable around you and this could
    lead to a decrease in inclusion at work and in life.</p>
