<div><br>Even though you may display all postures in different situations throughout your day, the posture that you will likely display most often is the posture of being <strong>Inviting</strong>. Being in this posture has some incredible advantages for you
    and your success is largely attributed to how you mastered this posture. However, like with so many other things in life, what is a Strength in one situation, may possibly be a Weakness in another. Being aware when to leverage on your default posture,
    but also when to pull back from that posture, will help you manage your energy, get along with people who live in other postures, and accomplish more in your day.<br></div>

<div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having an Inviting Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>When you demonstrate that Inviting Posture, you are in an open mood. You are the diplomatic team-member who is known as a good listener and who can find understanding in other people's points of view, even if you disagree with them. People like to come
    to you with their problems and you genuinely care about how they feel. In times of dramatic change, you are the person who will be asked to initiate a change-management strategy because you are known to be the person whom leadership can count on to
    take on this new challenge.</div>
<p><br></p>
<p><u><span class="font-large">Three Values of Being In An&nbsp;Inviting Posture:</span></u><br></p>
<p><strong>1. People Can Count On You For Support:</strong><br></p>
<p>When in an Inviting Posture, it is easy for you to feel empathetic for the people in your life. People feel like they can come to you with their problems and ideas because you are genuinely interested in what they are thinking and feeling. Care is your
    ally in an Inviting Posture and you're able to help people through challenges in a caring manner. Furthermore, you are open in your posture and are receptive to the input from others, even when their opinions differ from yours.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. You Bring Stability To The Conversation:</strong></p>
<p>In times of change or crisis, you tend to be approached as the person to lead change or crisis initiatives because you bring a sense of calmness and stability to the conversation. Your Inviting Posture has a de-escalating effect on people, which brings
    a much-needed sense of stability to the team. In Your Inviting Posture, you are more capable of seeing solutions to problems that others might miss, making you a valuable asset.<br></p>
<p><strong>3. You Are A Master Collaborator:</strong><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being in an Inviting Posture helps you&nbsp;prioritize and strengthen relationships over tasks. People enjoy spending time with you because you are so caring and empathetic. Your caring energy makes it easy for you to pull teams of people together to
    collaborate on projects. Finally, because people enjoy including you in their projects, you will receive a lot of opportunities to get involved in other projects that increase your visibility in the organization.</p>

<p><span class="font-large"><strong>Where Having an Inviting Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You So Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<div><br></div>
<div>Being in an Inviting Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of becoming everyone's doormat. Saying <strong>No</strong> is a challenge for you because you feel bad for people who have a problem and you want to be supportive and
    help them through their challenges. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people with challenges and sometimes taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling utterly exhausted by the end of the day. Being too open and inviting can be a challenge
    if you are stuck in that Inviting Mood all the time. A lack of assertiveness while being too agreeable could mean that you have too much on your plate. This in return could result in a less than satisfactorily quality of work and could even reduce
    your ability to meet deadlines altogether resulting in a reduction of trust in the people you work with.

<div><span class="font-large"><u></u></span></div>
<div><span class="font-large"><u>Three Challenges While Being In An&nbsp;Inviting Posture:</u></span></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. You May Be Viewed As Being Too Passive.</strong></p>
<p>In situations that require a different posture from being Inviting, you may find yourself feeling like a fish out of water. For example, in times of action where people turn to you for Decisive and Assertive leadership, your Inviting Posture may be interpreted
    as not being assertive enough.&nbsp;Over time, your team members may stop looking to you for direction, which could&nbsp;result in a break-down of communication and trust.</p>
<p><strong><br>2. You Struggle To Say No:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Being in an Inviting Posture may serve you well when supporting others, but being too supportive means that you end up with a lot of work on your plate. Saying No is difficult for you and after a while, people know to come to you to off-load
    everything. With too much on your plate, you sacrifice your self-care time to take care of others resulting in high levels of fatigue and potential burn-out. With too much on your plate and not enough time, the quality of your work drops, and you
    risk not making critical deadlines, which in turn may result in diminishing trust from your team and stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong><br>3. </strong><strong>You Struggle With Having Tough Conversations:</strong><br></p>
<p>People who have a tendency to be challenging in nature and are assertive in their opinions may make you feel uncomfortable when you are in an Inviting Posture. Your tendency to self-reflect and be thoughtful during conflict may make you appear as if you
    are not standing up for what you believe in or standing up for the people you work with. Being in an Inviting Posture in these situations may make it difficult for you to engage in a tough conversation and you may find yourself shying away from it
    or shutting down. This, in turn, may be interpreted as a sign of weakness by your team members.</p>

<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Wellness Concerns of an Inviting Posture</span></strong></p>

<p></p>
<div><br></div>
<p>Being in an Inviting&nbsp;Posture is characterized by being in an Open&nbsp;and Empathetic&nbsp;State, which requires the body and mind to be&nbsp;in a continuously receptive and reflective posture. When spending too much time in an open&nbsp;state, you
    may find yourself in a position where your body and mind become so accustomed to being receptive that&nbsp;creating forward momentum becomes difficult for you, such as doing something for yourself or driving your own ideas. The ability to be assertive
    with your own self-care&nbsp;is a necessary requirement for recovery and without recovery, you run the risk of burning out at some point if you spend too much time being in an Inviting&nbsp;Posture.</p>
<p>If you find yourself being in an Inviting Posture for too long, it will be important for you to practice deliberate self-care activities at strategic times of the day so your mind and your body have an opportunity to recover. One of the most effective
    ways of practicing this is to practice shifting yourself deliberately to another posture from time to time as each posture utilizes energy differently and therefore become complementary systems to your Default posture.</p>
<p>What this means is that practicing different postures does not only help you communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, it also becomes a practice of self-care and wellness while also being more effective in how you manage your work and
    relationships. But, before we can practice how to shift postures, let's first explore the other postures.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Determined Posture, you are able to drive initiatives and get things done. You are able to communicate clearly what you want and setting boundaries with others is easier for you. Being Determined also helps you thrive in a competitive
    environment and enables you to dominate in certain situations so you can exert autonomy and knowledge onto others. Being in a Determined posture enables you to focus on, and control outcomes. In this posture, you find yourself more able to be more
    questioning and be more independent-minded. You're more comfortable opposing other points of view and expressing your own point of view with conviction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Determined Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<p>Being in a Determined Posture all the time is exhausting! Posturing yourself to get people and projects moving requires a lot of energy and that energy is not always positive. Spending too much time in the posture of being Determined can result in burn-out
    in some people and for many people, it can feel difficult to move out of that space, even in a social setting or with the people you love.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Determined Posture all the
    time. Sometimes being Determined can be interpreted by others as being aggressive, forceful, and even met with distrust. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to work with you as much.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Light Posture -&nbsp;Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Light-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="zjei0brg21rl"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Light Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Light Posture, you are in a flexible mood. You are able to get along with everyone and you can find humor in almost any situation. Being Light helps you thrive in a competitive environment by building strong relationships and
    having a network of people who love to help you out where possible.</p>
<p>Your new-found enthusiasm, especially in times of crisis, can be a powerful antidote for stress and anxiety in your team-members. You become a beacon of hope and your ability to collaborate with anyone will open the&nbsp; door to opportunities that otherwise
    may never have been opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Light Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<p>Being in a Light Posture all the time can be challenging because life is not always fun and games. Being too flexible and sociable in times of urgency can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Light Mood. A lack of urgency could mean that deadlines
    are not met and promises are not kept. This in return could reduce trust in the people you work with.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Light Posture all the time. Sometimes being Light can be interpreted
    by others as being flakey and not able to take things seriously. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to recruit you in some exciting projects or even for more senior roles in your career.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Heavy Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Heavy-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="mqszw7dbrbys"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Heavy Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Heavy Posture, you are in an unmovable mood. You are the realistic team-member who is able to offer a sense of reality to the conversation. In a Heavy Posture, you know what you are talking about and are the specialist who is
    brought into the team who knows how to get from point A to point Z. Your work is meticulous and you take great comfort in working in a field where you are the expert.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having a Heavy Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in a Heavy Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who looks at everything from a "Glass Half Empty" perspective. One of the challenges that you can experience in this posture is that people don't
    like to include you in brain-storming sessions because they may perceive you as a bit of a buzz-kill. On top of that, if you encounter someone who is extremely passionate about their point of view, you tend to shut down rather than speaking up. This
    can result in the danger of becoming invisible and you may even find yourself being passed over for promotions by people who are less senior than you are.</p>
<p>Being too Heavy and Unmovable in your area of knowledge can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived positivity while not being assertive could be perceived by others as being "passive-aggressive" and may result in
    people not wanting to include you in larger conversations.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Neutral Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Neutral-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="5lxgp718b9yi"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Neutral Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Neutral Posture, you are in an accepting mood. You are the neutral team-member who is able to shift energy with anyone else in the room. In a Neutral Posture, you are instantly adaptable and can work with complete consciousness
    and mindfulness so you can be fully present and experience all factors of life and career with all required postures. You are emotionally unmoved by the events that happen in your life, leaving you with energy and vitality to spare.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where having a Neutral Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in a Neutral Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who doesn't care about the situation you are in. Display of emotion and mood is also extremely neutral making it difficult for people to read
    where you stand in your opinions and thoughts. This neutrality could lead to people not able to feel connected with you while working on a team and this could lead to distrust.</p>
<p>Being too Neutral and Unaffected can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived care while not displaying your passion for life and circumstances could lead to people not feeling comfortable around you and this could
    lead to a decrease in inclusion at work and in life.</p>
