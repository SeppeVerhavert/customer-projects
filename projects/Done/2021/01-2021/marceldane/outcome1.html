<div><br>Even though you may display all postures in different situations throughout your day, the posture that you will likely display most often is the posture of being <strong>Determined</strong>. Being in this posture has some incredible advantages for
    you and your success is largely attributed to how you mastered this posture. However, like with so many other things in life, what is a Strength in one situation, may possibly be a Weakness in another. Being aware when to leverage on your default
    posture, but also when to pull back from that posture, will help you manage your energy, get along with people who live in other postures, and accomplish more in your day.<br></div>

<div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>When you demonstrate that Determined Posture, you are able to drive initiatives and get things done. You are able to communicate clearly what you want and setting boundaries with others is easier for you. Being Determined also helps you thrive in a competitive
    environment and enables you to dominate in certain situations so you can exert autonomy and knowledge onto others.</div>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><u><span class="font-large">Three Values of Being In A&nbsp;Determined Posture:</span></u><br></p>
<p><strong>1. You Thrive In The Face Of Challenges:</strong><br></p>
<p>When facing challenges, adopting a Determined posture helps you rise to the occasion. Being in a Determined posture enables you to focus on, and control outcomes. In this posture, you find yourself more able to be more&nbsp;questioning and be more&nbsp;independent-minded.
    You're more comfortable opposing other points of view and expressing your own point of view&nbsp;with conviction. You are able to&nbsp;set clear boundaries in your relationships in work and in life.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. You Produce Results:</strong></p>
<p>When achieving results and outcomes is a priority, being determined in your posturing is essential. In a determined posture, you are able to apply laser point focus to get things done and achieve the necessary results to get where you need to go. Being
    determined means you are so driven, that you&nbsp;constantly look for new challenges and opportunities. You strive for success and become even more energized and motivated when you run into obstacles.<br></p>
<p><strong>3. When Action Is Required, You Are In Your Element:</strong><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being in a Determined posture helps you&nbsp;focus on achieving your goals quickly and forcefully. In this posture, you are quick to the point and rapidly shift your focus to what needs to get done so you can continue moving forward. Moving onward and
    upward is your comfort-zone and many of your successes in your life come from your ability to quickly step into that Determined posture so you can get the job done.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You So Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<div><br></div>
<div>Being in a Determined Posture all the time is exhausting! Posturing yourself to get people and projects moving requires a lot of energy and that energy is not always positive. Spending too much time in the posture of being Determined can result in burn-out
    in some people and for many people, it can feel difficult to move out of that space, even in a social setting or with the people you love.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Determined Posture all the
    time. Sometimes being Determined can be interpreted by others as being aggressive, forceful, and even met with distrust. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to work with you as much.

<div><br></div>
<div><span class="font-large"><u></u></span></div>
<div><span class="font-large"><u>Three Challenges While Being In A&nbsp;Determined Posture:</u></span></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. You May Be Viewed As Being Unsupportive.</strong></p>
<p>In situations that require a different posture from being Determined, you may find yourself feeling like a fish out of water. For example, your patience might be challenged&nbsp;in times where your team members just need you to be a listening ear resulting
    in you becoming tempted to just "give advice" or "give your opinions" so they can move on. This direct approach to "helping" your team, even though you have the best intentions, could be interpreted by them&nbsp;as you being insensitive to how they
    are feeling and what they are thinking. Over time, your team members may stop coming to you to brainstorm ideas and with that also stop coming to you with valuable feedback. Ultimately, this could result in a break-down of communication and trust.</p>
<p><strong><br>2. Being Determined Can Get Lonely.</strong><br></p>
<p>Being in a Determined posture may serve us well when doing individual tasks, but in times of collaboration, being in a Determined posture can be interpreted by others as being intimidating, aggressive, and overwhelming. Your ability to quickly think up
    solutions and move rapidly into action may be very challenging for people who feel more comfortable in a more stable setting. Your suggestions and ideas could be met with a great deal of resistance to people who need more stability and need time to
    weigh out all the options so they can feel more confident in taking steps forward. Because you are so result and solution-focused, people might begin to exclude you from broader brain-storming&nbsp;meetings and conversations. You may find yourself
    becoming extremely more isolated as more and more people begin to exclude you from their ongoing conversations.</p>
<p><strong><br>3. </strong><strong>Your Determined Posture Rocks The Boat:</strong><br></p>
<p>People who have a tendency to crave stability and certainty&nbsp;often focus on maintaining a predictable, orderly environment. People with this profile,&nbsp;tend to be more cautious, theyâ€™re likely to be more methodical and prefer to&nbsp;avoid rapid
    change where possible. For you, stability can be interpreted as being "boring" and may possibly make you feel impatient. Your driven nature may cause discomfort in people who crave stability and they may begin to perceive you as someone who makes
    life difficult for them.</p>

<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Wellness Concerns of a Determined Posture</span></strong></p>

<p></p>
<div><br></div>
<p>Being in a&nbsp;Determined Posture is characterized by being Forward Moving or Forward Thinking, which requires the body and mind to be&nbsp;in a continuous Activated State. When spending too much time in an activated state, you may find yourself in a
    position where your body and mind become so accustomed to being activated that&nbsp;de-activating becomes difficult for you. The ability to de-activate is a requirement for recovery and without recovery, you run the risk of burning out at some point.</p>
<p>If you find yourself being in a Determined Posture for too long, it will be important for you to practice deliberate de-activation activities at strategic times of the day so your mind and your body have an opportunity to recover. One of the most effective
    ways of practicing this is to practice shifting yourself deliberately to another posture from time to time as each posture utilizes energy differently and therefore become complementary systems to your Default posture.</p>
<p>What this means is that practicing different postures does not only help you communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, it also becomes a practice of self-care and wellness while also being more effective in how you manage your work and
    relationships. But, before we can practice how to shift postures, let's first explore the other postures.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Light Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Light Posture, you are in a flexible mood. You are able to get along with everyone and you can find humor in almost any situation. Being Light helps you thrive in a competitive environment by building strong relationships and
    having a network of people who love to help you out where possible.</p>
<p>Your new-found enthusiasm, especially in times of crisis, can be a powerful antidote for stress and anxiety in your team-members. You become a beacon of hope and your ability to collaborate with anyone will open the&nbsp; door to opportunities that otherwise
    may never have been opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Light Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
    </span><br></p>
<p>Being in a Light Posture all the time can be challenging because life is not always fun and games. Being too flexible and sociable in times of urgency can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Light Mood. A lack of urgency could mean that deadlines
    are not met and promises are not kept. This in return could reduce trust in the people you work with.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Light Posture all the time. Sometimes being Light can be interpreted
    by others as being flakey and not able to take things seriously. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to recruit you in some exciting projects or even for more senior roles in your career.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Inviting Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Inviting-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="zw4jmpggi589"></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having an Inviting Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>When you demonstrate that Inviting Posture, you are in an open mood. You are the diplomatic team-member who is known as a good listener and who can find understanding in other people's points of view, even if you disagree with them. People like to come
    to you with their problems and you genuinely care about how they feel. In times of dramatic change, you are the person who will be asked to initiate a change-management strategy because you are known to be that person whom leadership can count on
    to take on this new challenge.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having an Inviting Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in an Inviting Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of becoming everyone's doormat. Saying <strong>No</strong> is a challenge for you because you feel bad for people who have a problem and you want to be supportive and
    help them through their challenges. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people with challenges and sometimes taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling utterly exhausted by the end of the day. In this posture, it is also very difficult
    for you to prioritize your own wellbeing because you tend to put the needs of others first. Ultimately, this could result in burn-out.</p>
<p>Being too open and inviting can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Inviting Mood all the time. A lack of assertiveness while being too agreeable could mean that you have too much on your plate. This in return could result in a less than satisfactorily
    quality of work and could even reduce your ability to meet deadlines altogether resulting in a reduction of trust in the people you work with.</p>

<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Heavy-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="upuzfyf2fdjz"></p>
<p><br></p>

    into the team who knows how to get from point A to point Z. Your work is meticulous and you take great comfort in working in a field where you are the expert.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having a Heavy Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
<p>Being in a Heavy Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who looks at everything from a "Glass Half Empty" perspective. One of the challenges that you can experience in this posture is that people don't
    like to include you in brain-storming sessions because they may perceive you as a bit of a buzz-kill. On top of that, if you encounter someone who is extremely passionate about their point of view, you tend to shut down rather than speaking up. This
    can result in the danger of becoming invisible and you may even find yourself being passed over for promotions by people who are less senior than you are.</p>
<p>Being too Heavy and Unmovable in your area of knowledge can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived positivity while not being assertive could be perceived by others as being "passive-aggressive" and may result in
    people not wanting to include you in larger conversations.</p>

<p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Neutral Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Neutral-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="8w4sz67sbnvv"></p>

    and mindfulness so you can be fully present and experience all factors of life and career with all required postures. You are emotionally unmoved by the events that happen in your life, leaving you with energy and vitality to spare.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where having a Neutral Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>

    you where you stand in your opinions and thoughts. This neutrality could lead to people not able to feel connected with you while working on a team and this could lead to distrust.</p>
<p>Being too Neutral and Unaffected can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived care while not displaying your passion for life and circumstances could lead to people not feeling comfortable around you and this could
    lead to a decrease in inclusion at work and in life.</p>
