<div><br>Even though you may display all postures in different situations throughout your day, the posture that you will likely display most often is the posture of being <strong>Neutral</strong>. Being in this posture has some incredible advantages for you
    and your success is largely attributed to how you mastered this posture. However, like with so many other things in life, what is a Strength in one situation, may possibly be a Weakness in another. Being aware when to leverage on your default posture,
    but also when to pull back from that posture, will help you manage your energy, get along with people who live in other postures, and accomplish more in your day.

    <div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having a Neutral Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span></div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>When you demonstrate that Neutral Posture, you are in an accepting mood. You are the neutral team-member who is able to shift energy with anyone else in the room. In a Neutral Posture, you are instantly adaptable and can work with complete consciousness
        and mindfulness so you can be fully present and experience all factors of life and career with all required postures. You are emotionally unmoved by the events that happen in your life, leaving you with energy and vitality to spare.</div>

    <p><u><span class="font-large">Three Values of Being In A&nbsp;Neutral Posture:</span></u><br></p>
    <p><strong>1. You Bring Calmness To The Chaos:</strong><br></p>
    <p>When in a Neutral Posture, it is easy for you to tap into your breath and find your center even when life gets a little chaotic. During times of crisis or disruption, people will gravitate toward your sense of calm and will come to you for inspiration.&nbsp;Your
        neutral energy is accepting of the energies around you and that makes people in your team&nbsp;feel safe and comfortable around you. Your accepting nature raises psychological safety in your team so they feel more comfortable to share ideas, feedback,
        and concerns with each other and you.<strong><br></strong></p>
    <p><strong>2. You Embody Acceptance and&nbsp;Gratitude:</strong></p>
    <p>In times of change or crisis, people tend to turn to you for advice. Much more than your knowledge, you have the ability to accept any news, feedback, or opinions in a balanced manner. Your deep sense of gratitude helps you glide through your day,
        no matter what might be happening in your life.&nbsp;In your Neutral Posture, you are self-aware and fully present so you can fully experience every experience and event in your life with total consciousness.<br></p>
    <p><strong>3. You Embody&nbsp;Authentic Leadership:</strong><br></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Being in a Neutral Posture helps you&nbsp;prioritize doing the work necessary to produce results. You are not afraid to roll up the sleeves and get to work yourself. Nobody on your team is more dedicated to finishing the task and solving problems
        as you are. You are also a person of strong values and when you make a promise, you are committed to keeping that promise. Your ability to deliver results and dig deep into subject matter makes you a valuable asset on any team.</p>

    <div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where Having a Neutral Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You So Well:</strong>
        </span>
    </div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>&gt;Being in a Neutral Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who doesn't care about the situation you are in. The display of emotion and mood is also extremely neutral making it difficult for people
        to read where you stand in your opinions and thoughts. This neutrality could lead to people not able to feel connected with you while working on a team and this could lead to distrust.
        <p></p>
        <p>Being too Neutral and Unaffected can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived care while not displaying your passion for life and circumstances could lead to people not feeling comfortable around you and this
            could lead to a decrease in inclusion at work and in life.</p>

    <div><span class="font-large"><u>Three Challenges While Being In A&nbsp;Neutral Posture:</u></span></div>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>1. You May Be Viewed As Being DisInterested.</strong></p>
    <p>In situations that require a different posture from being Neutral, you may find yourself feeling like a fish out of water. For example, while the team is driving forward with an important initiative&nbsp;you may find that your Neutral Energy brings
        the energy of the team down. In these instances, your Neutral Posture may be interpreted as being disinterested or disengaged.&nbsp;Over time, your team members may stop including you in high-energy&nbsp;initiatives,&nbsp;which could&nbsp;result
        in a break-down of communication and trust.</p>
    <p><strong><br>2. You May Not Be Able To Fully Experience Life:</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong>Being in a Neutral Posture may serve you well when calmness inspires confidence. However, your Neutral Energy may come at a cost if you become stuck in your Neutral Posture. There are some instances in life where events are best experienced
        in extreme feelings, such as in joy, love, passion, and so on. Becoming stuck in a Neutral posture could make you experience life's gifts with flat energy levels thus reducing the full experience of your life.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><br>3. </strong><strong>You Struggle To Multi-Task:</strong><br></p>
    <p>One fact of modern-day life is that we live in a culture that requires us to be able to do multiple tasks simultaneously. When in a Neutral Posture, you may decrease your capacity to switch rapidly from one task to another. Your diminished capacity
        to quickly switch tasks may cause frustration in your stake-holders. Over time, this may result in your team-members not including you in dynamic initiatives or high urgency.</p>

    <div><br></div>
    <p>Being in a Neutral Posture is characterized by being in a Centered State, which requires the body and mind to be&nbsp;in a continuously balanced posture. When spending too much time in a balanced state, you may find yourself in a position where your
        body and mind become so accustomed to being balanced that&nbsp;initiating a change in posture becomes difficult for you. The ability to be agile in both mind and body is a necessary requirement for recovery. Without recovery, you run the risk
        of burning out at some point if you spend too much time being stuck in a Neutral Posture. And too much of anything is not healthy.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself being in a Neutral Posture for too long, it will be important for you to practice deliberate self-care activities at strategic times of the day so your mind and your body have an opportunity to recover from being Neutral. One
        of the most effective ways of practicing this is to practice shifting yourself deliberately to another posture from time to time as each posture utilizes energy differently and therefore become complementary systems to your Default posture.</p>
    <p>What this means is that practicing different postures does not only help you communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, it also becomes a practice of self-care and wellness while also being more effective in how you manage your work
        and relationships. But, before we can practice how to shift postures, let's first explore the other postures.</p>

    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Determined Posture -&nbsp;Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DeterminedPosture-2.png" data-image="jzr6byf0hxyd"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Determined Posture, you are able to drive initiatives and get things done. You are able to communicate clearly what you want and setting boundaries with others is easier for you. Being Determined also helps you thrive in
        a competitive environment and enables you to dominate in certain situations so you can exert autonomy and knowledge onto others. Being in a Determined posture enables you to focus on, and control outcomes. In this posture, you find yourself more
        able to be more questioning and be more independent-minded. You're more comfortable opposing other points of view and expressing your own point of view with conviction.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Determined Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
        </span><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Determined Posture all the time is exhausting! Posturing yourself to get people and projects moving requires a lot of energy and that energy is not always positive. Spending too much time in the posture of being Determined can result in
        burn-out in some people and for many people, it can feel difficult to move out of that space, even in a social setting or with the people you love.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Determined Posture
        all the time. Sometimes being Determined can be interpreted by others as being aggressive, forceful, and even met with distrust. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to work with you as much.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Light Posture -&nbsp;Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Light-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="27fxp0jwc6pt"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Light Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Light Posture, you are in a flexible mood. You are able to get along with everyone and you can find humor in almost any situation. Being Light helps you thrive in a competitive environment by building strong relationships
        and having a network of people who love to help you out where possible.</p>
    <p>Your new-found enthusiasm, especially in times of crisis, can be a powerful antidote for stress and anxiety in your team-members. You become a beacon of hope and your ability to collaborate with anyone will open the door to opportunities that otherwise
        may never have been opened.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Light Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
        </span><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Light Posture all the time can be challenging because life is not always fun and games. Being too flexible and sociable in times of urgency can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Light Mood. A lack of urgency could mean that deadlines
        are not met and promises are not kept. This in return could reduce trust in the people you work with.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Light Posture all the time. Sometimes being Light can be interpreted
        by others as being flakey and not able to take things seriously. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to recruit you in some exciting projects or even for more senior roles in your career.</p>

    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Inviting Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Inviting-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="tul6ypzn2mhk"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having an Inviting Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Inviting Posture, you are in an open mood. You are the diplomatic team-member who is known as a good listener and who can find understanding in other people's points of view, even if you disagree with them. People like to
        come to you with their problems and you genuinely care about how they feel. In times of dramatic change, you are the person who will be asked to initiate a change-management strategy because you are known to be the person whom leadership can count
        on to take on this new challenge.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having an Inviting Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>Being in an Inviting Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of becoming everyone's doormat. Saying <strong>No</strong> is a challenge for you because you feel bad for people who have a problem and you want to be supportive
        and help them through their challenges. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people with challenges and sometimes taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling utterly exhausted by the end of the day. In this posture, it is also very
        difficult for you to prioritize your own wellbeing because you tend to put the needs of others first. Ultimately, this could result in burn-out.</p>
    <p>Being too open and inviting can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Inviting Mood all the time. A lack of assertiveness while being too agreeable could mean that you have too much on your plate. This in return could result in a less than satisfactorily
        quality of work and could even reduce your ability to meet deadlines altogether resulting in a reduction of trust in the people you work with.</p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Heavy Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Heavy-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="4308hes2qlkv"></p>
    <p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Heavy Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Heavy Posture, you are in an unmovable mood. You are the realistic team-member who is able to offer a sense of reality to the conversation. In a Heavy Posture, you know what you are talking about and are the specialist who
        is brought into the team who knows how to get from point A to point Z. Your work is meticulous and you take great comfort in working in a field where you are the expert.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having a Heavy Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Heavy Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who looks at everything from a "Glass Half Empty" perspective. One of the challenges that you can experience in this posture is that people
        don't like to include you in brain-storming sessions because they may perceive you as a bit of a buzz-kill. On top of that, if you encounter someone who is extremely passionate about their point of view, you tend to shut down rather than speaking
        up. This can result in the danger of becoming invisible and you may even find yourself being passed over for promotions by people who are less senior than you are.</p>
    <p>Being too Heavy and Unmovable in your area of knowledge can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived positivity while not being assertive could be perceived by others as being "passive-aggressive" and may result
        in people not wanting to include you in larger conversations.</p>
