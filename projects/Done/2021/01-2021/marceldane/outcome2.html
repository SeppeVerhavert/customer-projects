    <div><br>Even though you may display all postures in different situations throughout your day, the posture that you will likely display most often is the posture of being <strong>Light</strong>. Being in this posture has some incredible advantages for
        you and your success is largely attributed to how you mastered this posture. However, like with so many other things in life, what is a Strength in one situation, may possibly be a Weakness in another. Being aware when to leverage on your default
        posture, but also when to pull back from that posture, will help you manage your energy, get along with people who live in other postures, and accomplish more in your day.<br></div>

    <div><span class="font-large"><strong>Where having a Light Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span></div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>When you demonstrate that Light Posture, you are in a flexible mood. You are able to get along with everyone and you can find humor in almost any situation. Being Light helps you thrive in a competitive environment by building strong relationships
        and having a network of people who love to help you out where possible.
        <p>Your new-found enthusiasm, especially in times of crisis, can be a powerful antidote for stress and anxiety in your team-members. You become a beacon of hope and your ability to collaborate with anyone will open the door to opportunities that
            otherwise may never have been opened.</p>

    <p><u><span class="font-large">Three Values of Being In A&nbsp;Light Posture:</span></u><br></p>
    <p><strong>1. You Bring Enthusiasm To The Table:</strong><br></p>
    <p>When in a Light Posture, it is easy for you to feel enthusiastic about new ideas and suggestions from others. Your upbeat nature makes it easy for you to communicate your ideas to others. Your high energy allows you to be positive, even in situations
        where others might not be. Humor is your ally in a Light Posture and you're able to get through challenges in a light-hearted manner. Furthermore, you are flexible in your posture and are able to quickly pivot in a new direction when required,
        making you more adaptable.<strong><br></strong></p>
    <p><strong>2. You See Opportunity In Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p>When presented with a challenge, you tend to approach those challenges with a sense of lightness that allows you to see a much bigger picture. Your ability to see larger concepts and bigger patterns in a state of lightness&nbsp;helps you identify
        solutions to problems that others might not see.&nbsp;In a Light Posture, you feel more confident taking risks and you are less afraid of possible negative outcomes. Finally, your Light Posture enables you to learn from your mistakes creating
        opportunities for growth in times of challenge.<br></p>
    <p><strong>3. You Are A Master Collaborator:</strong><br></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Being in a Light Posture helps you&nbsp;prioritize relationships over tasks. People enjoy spending time with you because you are so care-free, funny, and spontaneous. Your positive energy makes it easy for you to pull teams of people together to collaborate
        on projects. Finally, because people enjoy including you in their projects, you will receive a lot of opportunities to get involved in other projects that increase your visibility in the organization.</p>

    <p><span class="font-large"><strong>Where Having a Light Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You So Well:</strong>
        </span><br></p>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>Being in a Light Posture all the time can be challenging because life is not always fun and games. Being too flexible and sociable in times of urgency can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Light Mood. A lack of urgency could mean that deadlines
        are not met and promises are not kept. This in return could reduce trust in the people you work with.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Light Posture all the time. Sometimes being Light can be interpreted
        by others as being flakey and not able to take things seriously. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to recruit you in some exciting projects or even for more senior roles in your career.

    <div><span class="font-large"><u>Three Challenges While Being In A&nbsp;Light Posture:</u></span></div>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>1. You May Be Viewed As Being Out Of Touch With Reality.</strong></p>
    <p>In situations that require a different posture from being Light, you may find yourself feeling like a fish out of water. For example, in times of crisis where people turn to you for leadership, your Light Posture may be interpreted as not being serious
        enough.&nbsp;Over time, your team members may stop coming to you for guidance or direction, which could&nbsp;result in a break-down of communication and trust.</p>
    <p><strong><br>2. Urgency and Speed are&nbsp;Not Your Friends:</strong></p>
    <p><strong></strong>Being in a Light Posture may serve you well when working with others, but in times that require the sleeves to be rolled up and to do some heavy lifting, you may find yourself struggling. Your Light Posture may prevent you from developing
        a pinpoint focus when required making you susceptible to distractions. Your care-free nature may inhibit your ability to act with urgency in certain situations putting you at risk of missing deadlines and breaking promises, which ultimately can
        result in resentment from others and a breakdown of trust.</p>
    <p><strong><br>3. </strong><strong>You Shy Away From Having Tough Conversations:</strong><br></p>
    <p>People who have a tendency to crave stability and certainty&nbsp;often focus on maintaining a predictable, orderly environment and will question people who operate outside of their comfort areas. Your care-free and light-hearted nature can be uncomfortable
        for people who crave stability and you may find them pressing you hard in some situations. Being in a Light Posture in these situations may make it difficult for you to engage in a tough conversation and you may find yourself shying away from
        it. This, in turn, may be interpreted as a sign of weakness by your team members.</p>

    <p></p>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>Being in a&nbsp;Light Posture is characterized by being in a Flexible State, which requires the body and mind to be&nbsp;in a continuously adaptable posture. When spending too much time in a flexible state, you may find yourself in a position where
        your body and mind become so accustomed to being adaptable that&nbsp;finding stability becomes difficult for you. The ability to feel centered, balanced, and stable&nbsp;is a necessary requirement for recovery and without recovery, you run the
        risk of burning out at some point if you spend too much time being in a Light Posture.</p>
    <p>If you find yourself being in a Light Posture for too long, it will be important for you to practice deliberate Centering&nbsp;activities at strategic times of the day so your mind and your body have an opportunity to recover. One of the most effective
        ways of practicing this is to practice shifting yourself deliberately to another posture from time to time as each posture utilizes energy differently and therefore become complementary systems to your Default posture.</p>
    <p>What this means is that practicing different postures does not only help you communicate and collaborate with others more effectively, it also becomes a practice of self-care and wellness while also being more effective in how you manage your work
        and relationships. But, before we can practice how to shift postures, let's first explore the other postures.</p>

    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Determined Posture -&nbsp;Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DeterminedPosture-2.png" data-image="5afabwec908z"></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Where having a Determined Posture Might Serve You Well:</strong></span><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Determined Posture, you are able to drive initiatives and get things done. You are able to communicate clearly what you want and setting boundaries with others is easier for you. Being Determined also helps you thrive in
        a competitive environment and enables you to dominate in certain situations so you can exert autonomy and knowledge onto others. Being in a Determined posture enables you to focus on, and control outcomes. In this posture, you find yourself more
        able to be more questioning and be more independent-minded. You're more comfortable opposing other points of view and expressing your own point of view with conviction.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong><br>Where Having a Determined Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</strong>
        </span><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Determined Posture all the time is exhausting! Posturing yourself to get people and projects moving requires a lot of energy and that energy is not always positive. Spending too much time in the posture of being Determined can result in
        burn-out in some people and for many people, it can feel difficult to move out of that space, even in a social setting or with the people you love.<br><br>People in your environment don't always appreciate a person who is in the Determined Posture
        all the time. Sometimes being Determined can be interpreted by others as being aggressive, forceful, and even met with distrust. This, in return, may result in people not wanting to work with you as much.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Inviting Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Inviting-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="yyooks8qo1rf"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having an Inviting Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Inviting Posture, you are in an open mood. You are the diplomatic team-member who is known as a good listener and who can find understanding in other people's points of view, even if you disagree with them. People like to
        come to you with their problems and you genuinely care about how they feel. In times of dramatic change, you are the person who will be asked to initiate a change-management strategy because you are known to be that person whom leadership can
        count on to take on this new challenge.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having an Inviting Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>Being in an Inviting Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of becoming everyone's doormat. Saying <strong>No</strong> is a challenge for you because you feel bad for people who have a problem and you want to be supportive
        and help them through their challenges. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people with challenges and sometimes taking on too many responsibilities can leave you feeling utterly exhausted by the end of the day. In this posture, it is also very
        difficult for you to prioritize your own wellbeing because you tend to put the needs of others first. Ultimately, this could result in burn-out.</p>
    <p>Being too open and inviting can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Inviting Mood all the time. A lack of assertiveness while being too agreeable could mean that you have too much on your plate. This in return could result in a less than satisfactorily
        quality of work and could even reduce your ability to meet deadlines altogether resulting in a reduction of trust in the people you work with.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Heavy Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Heavy-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="okd85k13y0xv"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Heavy Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Heavy Posture, you are in an unmovable mood. You are the realistic team-member who is able to offer a sense of reality to the conversation. In a Heavy Posture, you know what you are talking about and are the specialist who
        is brought into the team who knows how to get from point A to point Z. Your work is meticulous and you take great comfort in working in a field where you are the expert.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where Having a Heavy Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Heavy Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who looks at everything from a "Glass Half Empty" perspective. One of the challenges that you can experience in this posture is that people
        don't like to include you in brain-storming sessions because they may perceive you as a bit of a buzz-kill. On top of that, if you encounter someone who is extremely passionate about their point of view, you tend to shut down rather than speaking
        up. This can result in the danger of becoming invisible and you may even find yourself being passed over for promotions by people who are less senior than you are.</p>
    <p>Being too Heavy and Unmovable in your area of knowledge can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived positivity while not being assertive could be perceived by others as being "passive-aggressive" and may result
        in people not wanting to include you in larger conversations.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><span class="font-xlarge"><strong>Neutral Posture - Overview</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="https://headstrongperformance.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Neutral-Posture-Traits.png" data-image="ah5wg0clht72"></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><strong><span class="font-xlarge">Where having a Neutral Posture Might Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>When you demonstrate that Neutral Posture, you are in an accepting mood. You are the neutral team-member who is able to shift energy with anyone else in the room. In a Neutral Posture, you are instantly adaptable and can work with complete consciousness
        and mindfulness so you can be fully present and experience all factors of life and career with all required postures. You are emotionally unmoved by the events that happen in your life, leaving you with energy and vitality to spare.<br><strong><span class="font-xlarge"><br>Where having a Neutral Posture Might <span style="color: rgb(244, 148, 30);">Not</span> Serve You Well:</span></strong><br></p>
    <p>Being in a Neutral Posture all the time can be challenging because you run the risk of being seen as someone who doesn't care about the situation you are in. Display of emotion and mood is also extremely neutral making it difficult for people to read
        you where you stand in your opinions and thoughts. This neutrality could lead to people not able to feel connected with you while working on a team and this could lead to distrust.</p>
    <p>Being too Neutral and Unaffected can be a challenge if you are stuck in that Mood all the time. A lack of perceived care while not displaying your passion for life and circumstances could lead to people not feeling comfortable around you and this
        could lead to a decrease in inclusion at work and in life.</p>
