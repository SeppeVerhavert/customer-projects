<p class="font-medium"><strong>YOUR SCORE:&nbsp;</strong>Your company scored at or below average in providing benefits and/or&nbsp;policies that actively support the wellbeing of its individual contributors. Based on this result, you may observe decreases in performance, as
    well as an increasing incidence of burn-out. Given that many people have been given a larger workload, creating an initiative around work communication boundaries that is observed by executives and managers alike can go a long way to protecting the
    wellbeing of employees and preventing burnout related attrition. Also, incentivizing time-off and leave benefits assures employees that utilizing their benefits won't harm their career growth.&nbsp;If you would like some support in leveling-up your

<p class="font-medium"><strong>WORK/LIFE BALANCE</strong>: $190 Billion dollars. According to new <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-your-workplace-might-be-killing-you" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Stanford research</span></a>, that
    is how much workplace stress - long hours, job insecurity and lack of work/life balance - is costing companies.</p>
<p>Although many companies institute wellness programs, such a smoking cessation, yoga and other mindfulness programs, there is a conspicuous inattention to the work environment itself. This connects directly with a culture of psychological safety and belonging.
</p>
<p>Without those foundational aspects of work, the stress and burnout are more than likely. Although many companies have impressive parental leave and other benefits, some of these companies have a culture where there is an implicit understanding that taking
    that time will cost your career advancement. Combine these "ghost benefits" with a psychological unsafe culture and it's a recipe for churn, low morale, decreased performance and flat revenue growth. </p>
<p>Attracting high-performers back to work and retaining them&nbsp;will require a commitment from companies to provide family-friendly benefits and policies to encourage their use. </p>
<p><strong>IN PRACTICE</strong>: Here are some practices and behaviors that are consistent with excellent work/life balance oriented companies to consider when addressing gaps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible work options</li>
    <li>Executives model by conspicuously practicing work/life balance</li>
    <li>Enforced "off grid" boundaries for employees regarding tech and work related communication</li>
    <li>Managers help balance performance with home responsibilities for team members</li>
    <li>Senior leaders and supervisors are visible and vocal about protecting mental and physical wellbeing</li>
