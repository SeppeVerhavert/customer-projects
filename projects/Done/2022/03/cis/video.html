<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(123, 67, 184);"><span class="font-small">Hope is a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen.</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="font-medium"><span class="font-small"><strong></strong>As the adage goes: <span style="color: rgb(123, 67, 184);"><strong>Hope Springs Eternal</strong></span>. This speaks to the fact that you yearn for more&nbsp;personal control – as in being the “master of your
    own ship” (not the same as self-control) - and&nbsp;have positive future plans to achieve it. You sometimes doubt your ability to be able to put&nbsp;yourself first. As such, you tend to suppress your aspirations (hopes and dreams) – personally&nbsp;and
    professionally - in order to “go along to get along”. However, you have an internal drive that&nbsp;keeps you moving toward the manifestation of your aspirations. Therefore, you will not settle&nbsp;for less than you deserve.<strong></strong></span>
