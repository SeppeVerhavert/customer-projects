<div>Way to go woman! As the Owner of Acceptance, you have the skill to acknowledge, own, embrace, and receive more often than other working women. You are accepting of oneself and one’s circumstances.</div>

<div>Born of self-awareness, amplified with self-love, and paired with a lack of criticism and negative judgment, acceptance emerges. As for that term “acceptance,” I’m not talking about passivity or bowing your head in resignation. And disappointments? Well,
    you need to admit those, too. Surely acceptance is a fundamental component within a process: a decidedly challenging one for many women. It first entails purposeful reflection. You need to face that mirror—look into your authentic self and ask some
    serious questions. You’ve got to continue to Identify your values, virtues, morals, and beliefs. Unearth those talents, passions, and visions. Allow and simultaneously own your worth, your might, and your extensive capabilities.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Continue to recognize your circumstances, from family to financial to logistical and more—the whole shebang, the entire gestalt. Distinguish the ideally independent women that you are today with a fine-tuned sense of where you’d like to be in the future.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Only when you discover your realities can you harness the qualities that constitute your identity, in order to truly acknowledge your powers of adequacy. And only when you comprehend what lies before, can you transform any perceived negatives into forces
    with which the world will reckon.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Acceptance begets growth. Owning and embracing your truths in the NOW becomes the base from which your journey will push forward. In other words, you accept what is to work with what ya got; build upon it to progress; and, subsequently, you will soar.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>As you ride the wave of life—managing your identity, children, careers, relationships, and everything in between—once these insights gel, well, you’re golden and the feeling is pure, real, and ALIVE.</div>
