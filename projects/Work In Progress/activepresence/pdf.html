<h1>Drunk in Charge of a Vehicle</h1>
<p>The quiz and case study show no hard and fast rule can be applied to every case.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">What will a Court take into Account?</h3>
<p>A Court will take account of all the following</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whether and where you are in the vehicle or how far you are from it</li>
    <li>What you were doing at the relevant time</li>
    <li>Whether you were in possession of a key that fitted the ignition</li>
    <li>Whether there was evidence of an intention to take or assert control of the vehicle by driving or otherwise</li>
    <li>Whether any person was in, at or, near the vehicle and, if so, the same information for them</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Clearly, matters are not straightforward.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left" class="text-align-left">Additional example</h3>
<p>Consider the following situation: </p>
<blockquote> A driver who knew they were above the limit, stated they intended to drive when he felt capable to do so.
    The driver had no way of knowing when their alcohol level would fall below the prescribed limit, nor did they
    produce any scientific evidence as to when that point might be reached.</blockquote>
<h3 align="left" class="text-align-left">The defence</h3>
<p>You would not be 'in charge' if you could prove that: at the material time the circumstances were such that there was
    no likelihood of your driving, so long as the proportion of alcohol in your breath/blood/urine remained likely to
    exceed the prescribed limit.</p>
<p>The burden of proof rests on you to prove this, but only on the basis of a balance of probabilities. You will need
    either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evidence that someone else was coming to drive the vehicle and you were not going to drive it; or </li>
    <li>Medical/scientific evidence to show when your alcohol level would be below the limit and you would not have
        driven before then.</li>
</ul>
