        <p>The team at LessLonely.com collaborated with leading global researchers from Harvard University, the University of Alabama, and the University of Canterbury in New Zealand to develop and validate the Team Connection Assessment<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
        <p>Items were generated from various relationship theories relevant to organizations <em>(e.g. high quality relationships, social support, relationship satisfaction/quality, loneliness, isolation, social disconnectedness)</em> and existing measures.
            These items were then tested by subject matter experts to ensure each item was measuring connection and relevant to the workplace. 600 participants were recruited via Prolific to test the validity and reliability of the items. All participants
            were employed full-time or part-time, had jobs that required interaction with coworkers, worked in at least one team/work group, and had a direct supervisor to whom they reported.</p>
        <p>Items were presented randomly to participants to avoid predetermined ‘conceptual clustering.’ Attention checks and Recaptcha scores ensured that humans were completing the survey and they were paying attention when doing so; as a result only two
            datasets were removed. Negatively worded items were reverse-scored so that higher scores on the scale represented higher connection.</p>

        <p>There were no statistically significant differences between genders on the Team Connection Assessment<sup>TM</sup> - components. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences between industry type and Team Connection Assessment<sup>TM</sup>            components. This means when conducting the survey across a diverse group of genders and industry type, the analyses can be collated and the results do not need to be analyzed separately for each gender group or each industry group.</p>
