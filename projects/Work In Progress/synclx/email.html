Hello!
<br> Congratulations on taking the first step toward a better connected, healthier and higher-performing team! Below is your link to take the Team Connection Assessment™ (TCA) as well as on how to invite your team members and generate the Team Report.
<br>
<br> Click the link below to launch <b>Your Assessment.</b> This assessment will provide the baseline scoring for the team report and assess your current connection level to the team. It will provide scoring on the 4 Levels of Team Connection and the
specific recommendations you can begin using to strengthen those connections.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<i>Do not share this link with anyone else as it is unique to you.</i>
<br>
<br> In a separate email you'll receive instructions on how to set up your account. From this portal you can send out the invitations to your team members as well as generate the team report.
<br>
<br> Start by adding your team members as contacts and adding them to all to a list. In the Personal ID field fill in "{{32.external_id}}", this passcode is used to link your team's responses to your own. Then head over to email invitations. Create a
new one and personalize the message to your team. Make sure to include the variable "Clickable link with Unique ID" in the body of the email.
<br>
<br> Once the email was sent out it's just a matter of time. You can follow up on your team members progress from the same email invitations menu by clicking the "Analyze Mail" tab.
<br>
<br> To view your results, go to "Questionnaires" and click on the speech bubble icon next to the Team Connection Assessment™ (TCA) Assessment. From this dashboard you'll be able to analyse your teams responses in detail. You can download the Team Report
by going to the Responses tab and downloading your own report.
<br>
<br> Thanks for prioritizing the connection of your team!
<br>
<br> Keep connected,
<br> The TCA Team
